# Microservices Order Management System

A scalable Microservices-based Order Management System built using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.  
The project demonstrates service discovery, centralized routing, JWT-based authentication, inter-service communication, and Docker containerization.

##  Architecture Overview

This project follows Microservices Architecture with the following components:

- **Eureka Server** – Service Discovery
- **API Gateway** – Centralized Routing
- **Auth Service** – JWT Token Generation & Validation
- **User Service** – User Registration & Management
- **Product Service** – Product Management
- **Order Service** – Order Processing
- **Payment Service** – Payment Handling

## API Endpoints (Via API Gateway)
http://localhost:8085

**1.Register (Auth User)**  
POST /auth/register  
Body
{  
  "username": "admin",  
  "password": "admin123"  
}    
**Postman Screenshot**

**2.Login (Generate JWT Token)**  
POST /auth/login  

Body

{  
  "username": "admin",  
  "password": "admin123"  
}    

 Response

{  
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."  
}  

 Save this token — required for all secured APIs.

 Authorization Header (IMPORTANT)

For all secured APIs, add this header:

**Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>**  
**Content-Type: application/json**

**3.User Service APIs (Secured)**

Create User  
POST /users  

Body

{  
  "name": "Ravi",  
  "email": "ravi@gmail.com"  
}

 Get All Users    
GET /users  

 Get User By ID  
GET /users/{id}


**4️. Product Service APIs (Secured)**   

Create Product  
POST /products  
Body

{  
  "name": "Laptop",  
  "price": 55000,  
  "stock": 10  
}

Input Validation & Error Handling   

![Alt Text](screenshots/product_exception.png)

Get All Products  
GET /products  

Get Product By ID    
GET /products/{id}  

**5️. Order Service APIs (Secured)**

Place Order  
POST /orders  
Body  
{  
  "userId": 1,  
  "productId": 1,  
  "quantity": 2  
}

**6️. Payment Service APIs**

Make Payment (Called by Order Service)  
POST /payments  
⚠️ Normally NOT called directly by client
Triggered automatically when order is placed.


##  Request Flow

1. Client sends request to API Gateway
2. API Gateway routes request to appropriate microservice
3. Services register themselves with Eureka Server
4. JWT token is validated for secure endpoints
5. Order Service communicates with Product & Payment services

## 🗄 Database Design (Database Per Service Pattern)

Each microservice maintains its own independent MySQL database to ensure loose coupling and independent scalability.

Database Structure:

- authuser_db → Authentication Service
- user_db → User Service
- product_db → Product Service
- order_db → Order Service
- payment_db → Payment Service

All SQL schema files are available inside the `/database` folder.



---

##  Docker Support

Each service includes Docker configuration for containerized deployment.

---

##  How To Run (Local)
---
1.Start Eureka Server
2.Start API Gateway
3.Start all microservices:
   Auth Service
